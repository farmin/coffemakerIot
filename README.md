# mokkamaster-autoff-iot

Simple project to demonstrate howto use Wifi and mqtt on a esp32 using the Arduino
framework. The project includes a custom sensor board that comunicates to host via
i2c. The sensor is ment to provide useful feedback from a MokkaMaster or similar type
of coffe machine.

## Installing

This project uses [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) as build platform. It installs from
terminal by typing in the following commands:
```
pip install platformio
cd ../coffemakerIot
platformio run
platformio run -t upload

```
### Prerequisites

You probably need pip to install platfomrio. you also need to add yourself to the dialout 
group.

```
python pip
sudo adduser $USER dialout
```

## Known bugs

I2c Bus dropouts, could be hw fault.
Wifi dropouts
